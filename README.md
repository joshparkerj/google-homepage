# google-homepage

## Odin Project 25 Mar, 2020
This project is about some basic html and css  
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

The suggested project was to build the google.com homepage and optionally the google.com search results page  
However, I've done those before so I decided to try a different page of similar complexity  
I decided to try www.smashingmagazine.com

The rule is that I have to recreate the look of the website *without peeking at their source code*. Here goes.

I'm just creating the one page, so there will be just the one index.html file. There will be a style.css file. There will be no javascript. All links will be dead.

here goes

the other note is that all image elements and assets will be downloaded from the smashing site.
